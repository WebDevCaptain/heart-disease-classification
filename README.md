# Heart Disease Classification

Problem Statement: Predict whether the patient has `heart disease` or not based on the `clinical data`.

---

## Activities and Tasks

- Experiment with popular classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN and Random Forest.

- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn.

- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.

- Visualizing the results using confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). We only use a subset of the original dataset with 14 features.
